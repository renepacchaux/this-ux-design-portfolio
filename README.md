# This UX Design Portfolio
## Sharpening the process

### Meta Challenge

Work on exercises daily. Let the design principles that I've learned become second nature.  It helps calibrate what I'm taking in.  It lets me subtract what mine from what is part of the user (the work) is.

### Meta Solution
1. user flows
2. thematic maps
3. timelines
4. gannt calendars
5. 'riskiest' feature assessments
6. cost-benefit cartesian-style plotting
