Think about what can make its all the way to the presentation stage. Apps in use range from Figma all the way to powerpoint. Here, we also be using use Webflow.

### The Design Tools

If it is a new project, I pick my work as user waypoints.


## Prototyping

For any digital product optimal usability is measured in seconds.
If the testing supports it, these spreadsheet-style analyses can do some heavy lifting. It can help you avoid digging for unsupported answers.


## Going for variations

It is justifiable to do this work upfront. It is most relevant when there is a natural way of playing with instinct.

The analysis is about filling in the gaps about the design destination. When someone clips and posts a poem, it defines the place for that community &#x2013; as long as it looks and feels like one.


## Starting a new project

I have found that of all the team collaboration tools I have used, discord works the best. I only ask for one alteration at the beginning of setting up a new workspace (or "server"). that is, give me channel so I and the rest of the team can put unrelated things. I will contribute to the vibe as well as welcome staying active on a new project.
Below is the research snippet I used to come up with the idea. It also works for new co-collaborators to the space. They now have a place to dial in on the mood of the place.

> An easy way to bring nostalgia into a server is not to create a slide deck of all the inside-jokes, rather create an "unrelated news clippings" channel, for example.
