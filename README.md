# This UX Design Portfolio

The design thinking is shown through sketches or whatever other means necessary You don't get sleek or modern, you get user flows

We are building for somebody, not just for aesthetics.

Unfinished

The UX portfolio is customized and re-customized to keep effectiveness

The portfolio should be a reflection of the process
