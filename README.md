# This UX Design Portfolio
## What is a UX Designer?

### Intro

Work on exercises daily. Let the design principles that I've learned become second nature.  It helps calibrate what I'm taking in.  It lets me subtract what mine from what is part of the user (the work) is.

#### Concise describing me
I want to explain UX as scooping ice cream. But first:  I code. I also describe by doing.  My inner dev says that I must  surpass a story about scooping and instead use templates to describe a platform agnostic process.

1. Can I describe what a UX designer is in 5 minutes?
2. Does it serve me well to bring up code?

You can tell a lot about someone from how they scoop their ice cream.  For some, are they calm and deliberate as they shape a concave space?  Why even come up with a random prerequisite to enjoy the first scoop out if the tub?  _What about the data_ 

Scoop tracking hardware exists.  I have not seen this,but I believe it to be true. What benefit would scale on the y axis?  What quadrant would  deduce *the subject* -- just eat the ice cream.
