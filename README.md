### Intro

Work on exercises daily. Let the design principles that I've learned
become second nature. It helps calibrate what I'm taking in. It lets me
subtract what mine from what is part of the user (the work) is.

**Consise describing me**

I want to explain UX as scooping ice cream. But first: I code. I also
describe by doing. My inner dev says that I must surpass a story about
scooping and instead use templates to describe a platform agnostic
process.

1.  Can I describe what a UX designer is in 5 minutes?
2.  Does it serve me well to bring up code?

You can tell a lot about someone from how they scoop their ice cream.
For some, are they calm and deliberate as they shape a concave space?
Why even come up with a random prerequisite to enjoy the first scoop out
if the tub?

**What about the data**

Scoop tracking hardware exists. I have not seen this,but I believe it to
be true. What benefit would scale on the y axis? What quadrant would
deduce *the subject* &#x2013; just eat the ice cream.
