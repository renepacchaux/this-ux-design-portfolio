## # UX Designer focus

**Breaking it down into pages**

Work on exercises daily. Let the design principles that I've learned
become second nature. It helps calibrate what I'm taking in.

It lets me subtract what mine from what is part of the user (the work)
is.

### Where UX Applies

**Platform Agnostic**

Most of the time, I describe by doing. In technology, templates mean
somthing slightly different than filling out a sign-up sheet or medical
form. They have moving parts to them.

1.  Can I describe what a UX designer is in 5 minutes?
2.  Does it serve me well to bring up code?

You can tell a lot about someone from how they scoop their ice cream.
Are they careful and deliberate? Are they calm where otherwise managing
a hectic lifestyle? I say these prerequisites are not random. There was
a design placed to the enjoyment the first scoop.

### What about the data

To notice small things that add up to big [Eye tracking software
exists](<https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/>). Its a short distance away from
â€˜scoop-tracking' software.

**hypothetical scoop tracking** What picture would this paint for us? Do
you measure the shape and volume of the first scoop? What number would
reveal that the subject just wanted to eat the ice cream?
