So if I had a hook in this piece and let the text or themes grow it, it would look a little like this:

A. Things i usually say
    1. When I write
    2. When I read

B. Change the way you think (hook)

D. Change the way I say things
    1. do i bring you into my circle of "lost"?
    2. do I do the bare minimum to get myself understand, i mean.. if it's worth saying at all?
    3. Do I do what i can use improvisation as an asset, not a liability?

C. Things I usually do

E. Change the way you think about a topic (hook)

F. Me, working on talking out loud

G. Me, trying to be fun

H. Me, embracing my tendency to jump topics as a unique ability

I. Change the way i think about myself (hook)
